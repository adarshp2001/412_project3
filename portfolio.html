                I created this website as a project in my Programming Studio & Foundations of Software Engineering class
                here at Texas A&M. The tools used in creating this website were HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.
                I used <a class="outside-link" href="https://github.tamu.edu/adarshp2001">TAMU GitHub </a> for
                revision control throughout the development of this website.

                Over the past two summers, I was given the opportunity to intern with <a class="outside-link" href="https://careers.homedepot.com">The Home Depot</a>.
                I was working with their supply chain network management team to create a user
                interface for the business team to use when making changes to the supply chain. As a part of this
                project, I also worked with their backend services and databases to connect them to the UI.
                I also interned with <a class="outside-link" href="https://careers.nokia.com">Nokia</a>! In my time here, I worked on a project that automated the
                updates and upkeep of many of their internal application demos used for B2B purposes.
