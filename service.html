				In my time at Texas A&M, I have participated in many service events around the Bryan-College Station
				area. I volunteered with <a class="outside-link" href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu">The Big Event</a>
				where I went to houses in the community and helped them with
				projects and tasks in and around their property. Kyle Field Day is another event that I have participated
				in these past 2 years. My student organization, <a class="outside-link" href="https://www.preptamu.com">PREP</a>,
				had a booth where we decorated brown lunch bags
				with motivational and fun messages. These bags were delivered to kids in the area who are on meal plans
				so that they get a positive message every day with their lunch at school. Within PREP, I went to weekly
				park cleanups hosted by the Keep Brazos Beautiful organization to help pick up trash at parks in the area.
				One of the biggest events that I take part in is Shack-a-thon, an event put on by Aggie Habitat for
				Humanity to raise awareness and funds about homelessness. As the Service Executive for PREP last year,
				it was my job to ensure that PREP made a Shack, and participated in the events that helped raise money
				for Aggie Habitat for Humanity!

				Service in Austin

				Before I had the opportunity to come serve on and around campus in College Station, I was active within
				the Austin area. In high school, I served as the President of my National Honor Society. As a member and
				leader of NHS, I helped coordinate our school's involvement in <a class="outside-link" href="https://www.projectlinus.org">The Linus Project</a>,
				a non-profit organization
				that makes homemade blankets for children in need. We helped them by creating tags and ribbons for the
				blankets as well as preparing the material that would be used for the blankets. NHS also helped put on
				the Eggstravaganza event at a local park. At this event, we would help hide Easter Eggs for kids to find
				during their hunt. Before and after the hunt, we would be working the booths and tables that had fun
				activities for the kids to part take in. Outside of NHS, at the end of every summer, I went to help
				<a class="outside-link" href="https://ec4a.org">Hindu Charities 4 America</a>, HC4A, pack school supplies for children of low-income families.
