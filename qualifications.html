				I have been around Computer Science my entire life as my Dad works in the industry. My
				first experience and real introduction to the subject was my sophomore year of high school when I
				took Computer Science 1. I wasn't the best at it and the subject didn't click for me right away.
				The teacher of that class did such a great job of keeping me motivated that I decided to challenge myself
				and take AP Computer Science 2. Sometime during my Junior year of high school, everything
				seemed to click and from that moment on I decided that I wanted to pursue Computer Science as a career.
				It took many hours and training myself to think critically, but I have come a long way in the past 5 years.
				My recent experiences and qualifications both related to and not related to computer science are
				highlighted below in my resume.

				I am a <a class="outside-link" href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/current-peer-teachers.html">Peer Teacher</a>
				for the Department of Computer Science at Texas A&M. Being a peer teacher has been a great opportunity for me to grow. It has opened my
				eyes and my mind to various thought processes. I have learned how to shift my thinking to understand what the student is thinking and
				the logic behind it. This experience has allowed me to grow as a learner. I have found myself able to grasp new ideas and concepts
				more quickly than I used to. A prime example of this was my summer internship with The Home Depot where I had never used or worked
				with any of the technologies needed for my project. Within one week of joining the team, I was already making steady progress on the project
				and by the end of the summer, my code was in production and being used by the business team.
